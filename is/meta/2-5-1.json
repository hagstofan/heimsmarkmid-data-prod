As the conservation and accessibility to these resources are of vital importance, medium- or long- term conservation facilities (genebanks) to preserve and make these resources and their associated information accessible for breeding and research have been established at country, regional and global levels. Inventories of genebank holdings provide a dynamic measure of the existing plant and animal diversity and its level of preservation. Data relevant to this indicator facilitate the monitoring of diversity secured and accessible through genebanks and support the development and updating of strategies for the conservation and sustainable use of genetic resources.</p>\n<p>The indicator is related to a monitoring framework endorsed by the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture in which the status and trends of plant and animal genetic resources are described through globally agreed indicators and regular country-driven assessments. </p>\n<p>The number of materials conserved under medium- or long-term storage conditions provides an indirect measurement of the total genetic diversity, which are managed to secure for future use. Overall, positive variations are therefore approximated to an increase in the agro-biodiversity secured, while negative variations to a loss of it. </p>\n<p>Caution needs to be paid in the reporting and interpretation of the indicator. In the case of plant genetic resources, an uncontrolled addition of accessions that are in fact duplicates of samples already conserved and accounted for, or, <em>vice versa</em>, the deletion from the reported collections of redundant duplicates may lead to wrong interpretations. In order to avoid duplicate counting at the national level, primarily base collections should be reported. An active collection could be reported, only when, in the absence of a base collection, it also serves the function of the base collection. Another example that needs to be monitored both while reporting and interpreting the results include the grouping or splitting of accessions, as in both cases the variation in the accounted number does not reflect a variation in the genetic diversity conserved and secured. Therefore, it is crucial that reporting countries and regional/international centres together with the accession level information requested explain also the reason for the decrease or increase in the number of accessions, in particular when this does not reflect a real loss or gain in the genetic diversity conserved and secured.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>Broadly, two issues are of concern in using the &#x201C;number of accessions&#x201D; as an indicator of diversity in <em>ex situ</em> collections:</p>\n<p>Undetected duplicates of accessions may contribute to an increase of the indicator, as each accession is a managed unit, kept and recorded as distinct. The detection of such duplicates will therefore result in a reduction in the number of accessions previously reported. This can occur at different levels, for example within genebank collections and also at international level.</p>\n<p>A loss of viability of the material(s) conserved that is not promptly detected may similarly not be reflected in the number of accessions, contributing to an overestimate of the actual number of accessions.</p>\n<p>Additional information could be provided by other indicators measuring <em>ex situ</em> conservation, which are part of the monitoring of the implementation of the Global Plan of Action for PGRFA under the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. </p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>The plant component of the indicator is calculated as the total number of unique accessions of plant genetic resources secured in medium to long term conservation facilities. This should include all the accessions in base collections, and unique accessions stored in medium term conservation facilities, as active collections, only when these accessions are considered to become part of the national base collections. Base collections may include both seed, field, cryo-preserved or <em>in vitro</em> collections depending on the species conserved and the available facilities in the country.</p>","DATA_VALIDATION__GLOBAL":"<p>There is no validation process in place.</p>","ADJUSTMENT__GLOBAL":"<p> Not applicable</p>","IMPUTATION__GLOBAL":"<ul>\n  <li><strong>At country level</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Missing values are treated as such and not replaced by estimates. </p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>At regional and global levels</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Missing values are treated as such and not replaced by estimates.</p>","REG_AGG__GLOBAL":"<p>Aggregates are the sum of country values.</p>","DOC_METHOD__GLOBAL":"<p>Officially appointed National Focal Points and managers of regional or international genebanks are requested to provide the list of accessions conserved in medium or long term conservation facilities by filling a spreadsheet contained in document <em>List of descriptors for reporting on the Plant Component of SDG indicator 2.5.1</em> (see References) accessible from the World Information and Early Warning System for plant genetic resources for food and agriculture (WIEWS) home page (<a href=\"http://www.fao.org/wiews\">http://www.fao.org/wiews</a>). Out of the 13 passport descriptors which can be used to characterize each accession, four are mandatory: (i) the name of the genebank (or <em>holding institute code</em>); (ii) the <em>accession number</em><sup><a href=\"#footnote-2\" id=\"footnote-ref-2\">[1]</a></sup>; (iii) the scientific name of the accession (<em>name of taxon</em>, including genus, species and lower taxonomic ranking); and (iv) the type of storage. </p>\n<p>Reporting on the remaining descriptors is highly recommended, as it allows the analysis of changes in different types of diversity concerned, including changes in the type and origin of the material secured (e.g. <em>biological status</em>; <em>country of origin</em>; <em>locations of safety duplications</em>; etc.) and better describes the composition of the secured materials. The descriptors have been agreed by the FAO Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (see question 6.2 in the <em>Reporting format for monitoring the implementation of the Second global Plan of Action for Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture</em> <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/3/a-mm294e.pdf\">http://www.fao.org/3/a-mm294e.pdf</a>).
