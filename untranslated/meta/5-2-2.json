Violence against women shall be understood to encompass, but not be limited to, the following: [&#x2026;], Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring within the general community, including rape, sexual abuse, sexual harassment and intimidation at work, in educational institutions and elsewhere, trafficking in women and forced prostitution [&#x2026;]&#x201D;. See here for full definition: http://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/48/a48r104.htm</p>\n<p>Sexual violence is defined as any sort of harmful or unwanted sexual behaviour that is imposed on someone.

We know that many abused women do not report violence and those who do, tend to be only the most serious cases. Therefore, administrative data should not be used as a data source for this indicator. </p>\n<p>For more information on recommended practices in production of violence against women statistics see: <em>UN Guidelines for Producing Statistics on Violence against Women- Statistical Surveys</em> (UN, 2014).</p>","COLL_METHOD__GLOBAL":"<p>An Inter-Agency Group on Violence against Women Data and its Technical Advisory Group is currently being established (jointly by WHO, UN Women, UNICEF, UNSD and UNFPA) to establish a mechanism for compiling harmonized country level data on this indicator.</p>","FREQ_COLL__GLOBAL":"<p>NA</p>","REL_CAL_POLICY__GLOBAL":"<p>NA</p>","DATA_SOURCE__GLOBAL":"<p>National Statistical Offices (in most cases) or line ministries/other government agencies that have conducted national surveys on violence against women and girls.</p>","COMPILING_ORG__GLOBAL":"<p>UN Women, UNICEF, UNSD, WHO, UNFPA</p>","RATIONALE__GLOBAL":"<p>Violence against women and girls is one of the most pervasive forms of human rights violations in the world. Evidence has shown that globally, an estimated 7% of women have been sexually assaulted by someone other than a partner at some point in their lives (WHO et al., 2013). Having data on this indicator will help understand the extent and nature of this form of violence and develop appropriate policies and programmes.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p><u>Comparability:</u></p>\n<p>The availability of comparable data remains a challenge in this area as many data collection efforts have relied on different survey methodologies and used different definitions of sexual violence and different survey question formulation. Diverse age groups are also often utilized. Willingness to discuss experiences of violence and understanding of relevant concepts may also differ according to the cultural context and this can affect reported prevalence levels.</p>\n<p>Efforts and investment will be required to develop an internationally-agreed standard and definition of sexual violence by non-partners that will enable comparison across countries.</p>\n<p><u>Regularity of data production:</u></p>\n<p>Since 1995, only some 40 countries have conducted more than one survey on violence against women and girls. Obtaining data on violence against women and girls is a costly and time-consuming exercise, no matter if they are obtained through stand-alone dedicated surveys or through modules inserted in other surveys. Not all VAW surveys, however, collect information on non-intimate partner violence. Monitoring this indicator with certain periodicity may be a challenge if sustained capacities are not built and financial resources are not available.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>This indicator calls for disaggregation by age group and place of occurrence.
