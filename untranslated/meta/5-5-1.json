National parliaments also transmit their data to the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) at least once a year and when the numbers change significantly. IPU member parliaments provide information on changes and updates to the IPU secretariat. After each general election or renewal, a questionnaire is dispatched to parliaments to solicit the latest available data. If no response is provided, other methods are used to obtain the information, such as from the electoral management body, parliamentary websites, or Internet searches.

It was founded in 1889 as the first multilateral political organization in the world, encouraging cooperation and dialogue between all nations. Today, the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) comprises 179 national Member Parliaments and 13 regional parliamentary bodies. It promotes democracy and helps parliaments become stronger, younger, gender-balanced, and more diverse. </p>\n<p>The IPU recognizes gender equality as a key component of democracy. It works to achieve equal participation of men and women in politics and supports parliaments in advancing gender equality. This includes the collection and dissemination of quantitative and qualitative data on women in politics. In particular, the IPU has tracked the percentage of women in national parliaments since 1945 and is the authority for this data. See historical and comparative data on women in parliament at <a href=\"https://data.ipu.org/historical-women\">https://data.ipu.org/historical-women</a>. </p>","RATIONALE__GLOBAL":"<p>The indicator measures the degree to which women have equal access to parliamentary decision-making. Women&#x2019;s participation in parliaments is a key aspect of women&#x2019;s opportunities in political and public life and is linked to women&#x2019;s empowerment. Equal numbers of women and men in lower chambers would give an indicator value of 50 percent.</p>\n<p>A stronger presence of women in parliament allows new concerns to be highlighted on political agendas, and new priorities to be put into practice through the adoption and implementation of policies and laws. The inclusion of the perspectives and interests of women is a prerequisite for democracy and gender equality and contributes to good governance. A representative parliament also allows the different experiences of men and women to affect the social, political, and economic future of societies.</p>\n<p>Changes in the indicator have been tracked over time. Although the international community has supported and promoted women&#x2019;s participation in political decision-making structures for several decades, improvement in women&#x2019;s access to parliament has been slow. This has led to the introduction of special policies and legal measures to increase women&#x2019;s shares of parliamentary seats in several countries. Those countries that have adopted special measures generally have greater representation of women in parliament than countries without special measures.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>- The number of countries covered varies with suspensions or dissolutions of parliaments. As of 1 February 2016, 193 countries are included.</p>\n<p>- There can be difficulties in obtaining information on by-election results and replacements due to death or resignation. These changes are ad hoc events that are more difficult to keep track of. By-elections, for instance, are often not announced internationally as general elections are.</p>\n<p>- The data excludes the numbers and percentages of women in the upper chambers of parliament. The information is available on the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) website at <a href=\"https://data.ipu.org/women-ranking\">https://data.ipu.org/women-ranking</a>.</p>\n<p>- Parliaments vary considerably in their internal workings and procedures, however, generally legislate, oversee government and represent the electorate. In terms of measuring women&#x2019;s contribution to political decision-making, this indicator may not be sufficient because some women may face obstacles in fully and efficiently carrying out their parliamentary mandate.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>The proportion of seats held by women in the national parliament is derived by dividing the total number of seats occupied by women by the total number of seats in parliament.</p>\n<p>There is no weighting or normalising of statistics.</p>","DATA_VALIDATION__GLOBAL":"<p>Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) member parliaments provide information on changes and updates to the IPU secretariat via IPU Groups within each parliamentary chamber or via the Parline Correspondent&#x2019;s Network. </p>\n<p>Parline Correspondents are staff members of national parliaments who act as the IPU focal point for IPU&#x2019;s Parline database within each chamber or parliament.
