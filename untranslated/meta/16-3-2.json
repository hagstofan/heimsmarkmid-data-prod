This, in turn, is premised on aspects of the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty. From a development perspective, extensive use of pre-sentence detention when not necessary for reasons such as the prevention of absconding, the protection of victims or witnesses, or the prevention of the commission of further offences, can divert criminal justice system resources, and exert financial and unemployment burdens on the accused and his or her family. Measuring the relative extent to which pre-sentence detention is used can provide the evidence to assist countries in lowering such burdens and ensuring its proportionate use. </p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>The target relates to the multidimensional concepts of rule of law and access to justice and at least two indicators are required to cover the main elements of access to justice and efficiency of the justice system. The proposed indicator 16.3.2 covers the efficiency of the justice system.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, it is not straightforward to define a concrete target for Indicator 16.3.2. This is because pre-sentence detention is a constitutive part of the criminal justice process and a very low share of of unsentenced detainees (e.g. close to zero) is not necessarily reflective of an accessible and fair criminal justice process.</p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>The indicator is calculated as the total number of unsentenced persons held in detention divided by the total number of persons held in detention on a specified date, multiplied by 100</p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <msub>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>P</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>r</mi>\n        <mi>c</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n        <mi>t</mi>\n        <mi>a</mi>\n        <mi>g</mi>\n        <mi>e</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n      </mrow>\n    </msub>\n    <mo>=</mo>\n    <mn>100</mn>\n    <mi>*</mi>\n    <mfrac>\n      <mrow>\n        <msub>\n          <mrow>\n            <mi>P</mi>\n            <mi>e</mi>\n            <mi>r</mi>\n            <mi>s</mi>\n            <mi>o</mi>\n            <mi>n</mi>\n            <mi>s</mi>\n            <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n            <mi>h</mi>\n            <mi>e</mi>\n            <mi>l</mi>\n            <mi>d</mi>\n            <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n            <mi>u</mi>\n            <mi>n</mi>\n            <mi>s</mi>\n            <mi>e</mi>\n            <mi>n</mi>\n            <mi>t</mi>\n            <mi>e</mi>\n            <mi>n</mi>\n            <mi>c</mi>\n            <mi>e</mi>\n            <mi>d</mi>\n          </mrow>\n          <mrow>\n            <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n          </mrow>\n        </msub>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <msub>\n          <mrow>\n            <mi>P</mi>\n            <mi>e</mi>\n            <mi>r</mi>\n            <mi>s</mi>\n            <mi>o</mi>\n            <mi>n</mi>\n            <mi>s</mi>\n            <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n            <mi>h</mi>\n            <mi>e</mi>\n            <mi>l</mi>\n            <mi>d</mi>\n          </mrow>\n          <mrow>\n            <mi>&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n          </mrow>\n        </msub>\n      </mrow>\n    </mfrac>\n  </math></p>\n<p>For the percentage by sex, the number of persons held unsentenced of that sex should be divided by the number of persons held of the same sex.</p>","DATA_VALIDATION__GLOBAL":"<p>Following the submission of the UN-CTS questionnaire, UNODC checks for consistency and coherence with other data sources.

For each regional aggregate, the number persons held should correspond to the sum of all national data of such in the region, in each year. However, for many countries, data on persons held are not available, or data are available only for some years . As a result, the sample of countries with available data is different for each year. If left unaddressed, this issue would result in inconsistencies, as regional aggregates would be drawn from a different set of countries each year.</p>\n<p>Imputations for total persons held are performed on the country-level rate of total persons held per 100,000 population. If a country has just one available data point since the year 2000, all missing values are set equal to this single available data point. This approach therefore accounts for population growth over time and does not mean that the series is constant in absolute terms.</p>\n<p>If a country has two to eight available data points, the missing values between two data points are estimated by linear interpolation, and if there are missing values that are temporally before (or after) the earliest (or latest) available data point, the values at the beginning (or end) of the series are filled with the earliest (or latest) available data point. If a country has more than eight available data points in the respective time series, the missing values between two data points are estimated by linear interpolation, and if there are missing values that are temporally before (or after) the earliest (or latest) available data point, the values at the end of the time series are imputed using an exponential smoothing approach (for more information, see <a href=\"https://afit-r.github.io/ts_exp_smoothing\">https://afit-r.github.io/ts_exp_smoothing</a>).<sup><a href=\"#footnote-2\" id=\"footnote-ref-2\">[1]</a></sup> </p>\n<p>Once the series have been computed at the national level, they are aggregated at the regional level.
