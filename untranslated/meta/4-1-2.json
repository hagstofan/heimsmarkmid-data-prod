It will continue to produce international monitoring indicators based on its annual education survey and on other data sources that guarantee international comparability for more than 200 countries and territories. In addition to collecting data, the UIS will work with partners to develop new indicators, statistical approaches and monitoring tools to better assess progress across the targets related to UNESCO&#x2019;s mandate, working in coordination with the SDG-Education 2030 SC&#x201D;.</em></p>","RATIONALE__GLOBAL":"<p>The indicator is explicitly referenced in the text of target 4.1: &#x2018;ensure that all girls and boys complete [&#x2026;] primary and secondary education&#x2019;. A completion rate at or near 100% indicates that all or most children and adolescents have completed a level of education by the time they are 3 to 5 years older than the official age of entry into the last grade of that level of education. A low completion rate indicates low or delayed entry into a given level of education, high drop-out, high repetition, late completion, or a combination of these factors.</p>\n<p>The completion rate can be used either as a self-standing indicator or in combination with SDG indicator 4.1.1 (proportion of children and young people (a) in Grade 2 or 3; (b) at the end of primary education; and (c) at the end of lower secondary education achieving at least a minimum proficiency level in (i) reading and (ii) mathematics). Combining the completion rate with indicator 4.1.1 provides information on the percentage of children or young people in a cohort who achieve a minimum level of proficiency, and not only on the percentage of children in school who achieve minimum proficiency.</p>","REC_USE_LIM__GLOBAL":"<p>Three common issues affect the indicator. First, the age group 3-5 years above the official age of entry into the last grade for a given level of education was selected for the calculation of the completion rate to allow for some delayed entry or repetition. In countries where entry can occur very late or where repetition is common, some children or adolescents in the age group examined may still attend school and the eventual rate of completion may therefore be underestimated. Second, as the indicator is calculated from household survey data, it is subject to time lag in the availability of data. Third, when multiple surveys are available, they may provide conflicting information due to the possible presence of sampling and non-sampling errors in survey data. </p>\n<p>Responding to a request by the Technical Cooperation Group (TCG) on the Indicators for SDG 4 - Education 2030, a refinement of the methodology to model completion rate estimates has been developed (Barakat et al. 2021), following an approach similar to that used for the estimation of child mortality rates. The model ensures that these common challenges with household survey data, such as timeliness and sampling or non-sampling errors are addressed to provide annual, up-to-date (through short-term projections) and more robust data, including for children and youth who complete each level later than 3-5 years above the official age of entry into the last grade. </p>","DATA_COMP__GLOBAL":"<p>The number of persons in the relevant age group who have completed the last grade of a given level of education is divided by the total population (in the survey sample) of the same age group.</p>\n<p>Formula:</p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <msub>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>C</mi>\n        <mi>R</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n      </mrow>\n    </msub>\n    <mo>=</mo>\n    <mfrac>\n      <mrow>\n        <msub>\n          <mrow>\n            <mi>P</mi>\n          </mrow>\n          <mrow>\n            <msub>\n              <mrow>\n                <mi>C</mi>\n              </mrow>\n              <mrow>\n                <mi>n</mi>\n              </mrow>\n            </msub>\n            <mo>,</mo>\n            <msub>\n              <mrow>\n                <mi>A</mi>\n                <mi>G</mi>\n              </mrow>\n              <mrow>\n                <mi>a</mi>\n                <mo>+</mo>\n                <mn>3</mn>\n                <mi>t</mi>\n                <mn>5</mn>\n              </mrow>\n            </msub>\n          </mrow>\n        </msub>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <msub>\n          <mrow>\n            <mi>P</mi>\n          </mrow>\n          <mrow>\n            <msub>\n              <mrow>\n                <mi>A</mi>\n                <mi>G</mi>\n              </mrow>\n              <mrow>\n                <mi>a</mi>\n                <mo>+</mo>\n                <mn>3</mn>\n                <mi>t</mi>\n                <mn>5</mn>\n              </mrow>\n            </msub>\n          </mrow>\n        </msub>\n      </mrow>\n    </mfrac>\n  </math></p>\n<p>where:</p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <msub>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>C</mi>\n        <mi>R</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>n</mi>\n      </mrow>\n    </msub>\n    <mo>=</mo>\n  </math> completion rate for level n of education</p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <msub>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>P</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <msub>\n          <mrow>\n            <mi>C</mi>\n          </mrow>\n          <mrow>\n            <mi>n</mi>\n          </mrow>\n        </msub>\n        <mo>,</mo>\n        <msub>\n          <mrow>\n            <mi>A</mi>\n            <mi>g</mi>\n            <mi>e</mi>\n          </mrow>\n          <mrow>\n            <mi>a</mi>\n            <mo>+</mo>\n            <mn>3</mn>\n            <mi>t</mi>\n            <mn>5</mn>\n          </mrow>\n        </msub>\n      </mrow>\n    </msub>\n    <mo>=</mo>\n  </math> population aged 3 to 5 years above the official entrance age <em>a</em> into the last grade of level <em>n</em> of education who completed level <em>n</em></p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <msub>\n      <mrow>\n        <mi>P</mi>\n      </mrow>\n      <mrow>\n        <msub>\n          <mrow>\n            <mi>A</mi>\n            <mi>g</mi>\n            <mi>e</mi>\n          </mrow>\n          <mrow>\n            <mi>a</mi>\n            <mo>+</mo>\n            <mn>3</mn>\n            <mi>t</mi>\n            <mn>5</mn>\n          </mrow>\n        </msub>\n      </mrow>\n    </msub>\n    <mo>=</mo>\n  </math> population aged 3 to 5 years above the official entrance age <em>a</em> into the last grade of level <em>n</em> of education</p>\n<p><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\">\n    <mi>n</mi>\n    <mo>=</mo>\n    <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">&amp;nbsp;</mi>\n  </math>ISCED level 1 (primary education), 2 (lower secondary education), or 3 (upper secondary education)</p>","DATA_VALIDATION__GLOBAL":"<p>The UNESCO Institute for Statistics shares all indicator values and notes on methodology with National Statistical Offices (NSO), Ministries of Education, or other relevant agencies in individual countries for their review, feedback and validation before the publication of the data.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>In a different validation and capacity building exercise, the completion rate model estimates will be consulted with countries.
